| `baseline.py`         | Implements the **standard attack**, where \$y\$ is the product of smallest primes in \$(n, n^2)\$ until \$y < 2^n\$. Also includes theoretical and empirical analysis functions. |
| `Alternative.py`      | Implements **alternative adversarial strategies**                  |
| `Simulations.py` and `Plot for deliverable 1.py` | Runs all three strategies across a range of values of \$n\$, printing both **theoretical** and **empirical false-positive rates** side by side. 
| `Deliverable 2.py`      | Implements **Empirical Results and Analysis of Miller-Rabin**   |
